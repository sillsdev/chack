# Building

## On Linux

Simply run build.sh. This will download the required Firefox (14.0.1), compile the project and
copy the dependencies to output/Debug.

After Firefox got downloaded you can also build in MonoDevelop by opening `Chorus VS2010.sln` and
compiling the solution in MD.

## On Windows

Open and compile `Chorus VS2010.sln` in Visual Studio 2010.

# Running the sample

The sample app can be found `output/Debug`. On Linux it can be run with the `sampleapp` script.
